# SpringMVCFindEmployee
In real world scenarios, organizations are existing in different localities. Employees are available in many locations. 
Sometimes they work in different 2 locations i.e. for few days, they work on location 1 and for few other days, 
they work on location 2. Lets simulate this scenario via MySQL queries and prepare a Spring MVC application that interacts 
with MySQL and get the required details.
